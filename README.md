### Evolution of decision trees

This project implements and experiments with the evolutionary algorithm optimizing decision trees.
The implemented algorithm is also compared with an implementation of ID3 algorithm available on pip.

It was written as part of UMA (Uczenie Maszynowe, Machine Learning) class in semester 23Z (winter 2023).

The project is written in Python 3.11, using libraries specified in `requirements.txt`.

More detailed documentation, experiment results and conclusions are available in Polish in the
file `dokumentacja ko≈Ñcowa.pdf`.
